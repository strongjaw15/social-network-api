## Description

This project is a backend node server for social media API calls. It stores data in a Mongo database and uses Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose in the server. I wanted to make something that would store user data, thoughts or posts, reactions, and friend connections in a NoSQL db, and set it up so that I could interact with it from a platform such as Insomnia. In working on this project I learned how to use MongoDB and Mongoose, and got more comfortable with setting up an express server to handle API calls.

## Installation

To install, download the repo, open a terminal in the root folder, and run "npm install".

## Usage

To start the server after installation, enter "node server" into the terminal open in the root folder. Then check the specific routes in the routes folders for use with an app like Insomnia or Postman. Refer to the walkthrough video for more details.
